# Personal Dual Gas Detector

## Requirements:

A handheld dual gas detector

## Responsibilities:

Industrial Design, Mechanical Design, vendor development, testing, documentation and client relationship

## Results:

* Engineered to detect CO and Hâ‚‚S with high accuracy
* Led industrial and mechanical design, overseeing manufacturing from concept to 10K units/year production
* Designed and tested to meet IS and CSA standards
* Conducted drop, leak (IP67), impact, and thermal endurance testing to ensure reliability in harsh environments
* Utilized injection molding, overmolding and snap-fit mechanism
